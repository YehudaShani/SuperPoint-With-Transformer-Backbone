# Ethical statement  
## Stakeholders:  
- Computer vision researchers and developers working on SLAM, AR/VR, and robotics.  
- Companies deploying vision-based systems in navigation, mapping, or object tracking.  
- The general public whose images or environments may be processed by such systems.  

## Implications:  
Teams can optimize performance and race strategies, though over-reliance may limit human adaptability. Broadcasters and commentators can enhance analysis, enriching the fan experience with deeper insights.  

## Ethical Considerations:  
There must be clear boundaries on acceptable use. As the amount of surveillance grows exponentially, models that can extract data from such systems could pose significant privacy risks.
